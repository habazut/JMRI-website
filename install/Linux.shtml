      This page describes general aspects of installing JMRI on Linux.
      
      <p>
      There are multiple versions of Linux, all slightly different and
      requiring installation instructions that differ in detail.
      There are specific pages describing details of
      installation on
      <ul>
	<li><a href="Ubuntu.shtml">Ubuntu (including Xubuntu, Debian etc</a>
	<li>Fedora (including CentOS, RedHat etc) - To be added 
      </ul>
	        Some Linux distributions have associated repositories that make it easier to
	        install software.  If you have one of those, you can find more info at:
	            <ul>
	            <li><a href="https://slackbuilds.org/apps/jmri/">Slackware</a>
	            </ul>
       <p> There are more examples below at the bottom of the page but these are probably outdated </p>

       <h2>The general procedure to install JMRI is:</h2>
				<ol>
				<li>Determine if your hardware supports Java and JMRI</li>

				<a name="sysreq"></a><h3>JMRI System Requirements</h3>
				<p>Using JMRI requires a combination of hardware (in this case running Linux), Java software and a JMRI download for a specific version.
				<p>JMRI&reg; version 4.2 requires Java 1.8 or later.<br>
				Version 3.10.1 requires Java 1.6 or later.<br>
				Version 2.14.1 requires Java 1.5 (or 1.6 if you wish for drag &amp; drop).<br>
				Version 2.12 requires Java 1.5 or later.
				</p>
				
				<p>These steps outline how to install DecoderPro on Linux.
				These steps should work on a generic modern Linux distro.
				</p>
				
				<p>You'll need the correct serial port or USB port
				to attach to your layout hardware.  JMRI is compatible
				with USB-to-Serial adapters, so long as they have 
				Linux drivers that make them look like regular serial ports.
				For troubleshooting, see the 
				<a href="FAQLinux.html#usb">FAQ</a></p>
				
				<li>Get and Install Java (if needed)</li>
				
				<p>See if you have a version of Java already installed<p>
				<p class="example"> $ java -version</p>
				
				<p>If the Java version is 1.8 or later, you may be fine, but
				   be aware that if you did not install Java on your system
				   yourself, some systems have Java only partially installed. They
				   will respond correctly to the above command, but still are not
				   all there. Recommendation is to install a full Java JDK on
				   your computer </p>

				<p>If your Java version is not at least 1.8, or if you get a "java: not found"
				error, you will need to install it.</p>

                                <p> Java comes often in two levels: </p>
                                <ul>
				  <li> JRE (Java Runtime Environment): You need only this if you only run JMRI "as is"
				  <li> JDK (Java Development Kit): You need this if you want to debug or develop JMRI
				</ul>

				<p><b> Open your software install tool
				  and search for jdk (or jre). On my
				  Linux I found the meta package
				  default-jdk which installed openjdk.</b>
				  If you are not short on disk space
				  go for the complete JDK. </p>
				
				<p>If the above does not work or if you have a really old Linux distribution
				  then you  might get an automated install download
				from Oracle by clicking on this button:<br>
				<a href="http://www.java.com" target="_blank">
				<img src="https://download.oracle.com/technetwork/java/get-java/getjavasoftware-88x31.png" alt="Get Java Software" border="0" width="88" height="31" />
				</a>

				<p>If that doesn't work or you need to manually install Java,
				    you can find further information on the 
				    <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html"> Oracle Java downloads page</a>.  
				    <ul>
				    <li>Java comes in several forms: 
				    JMRI needs the Standard Edition (SE) version, but
				    Java EE is also OK;<br>
				    neither Java ME or Java Embedded are sufficient.
				    <li>There are also different Java SE installers: JMRI can
				    run with either a proper SDK (Software Development Kit, for compiling and running Java)
				    or JRE (Java Runtime Environment, for just running Java) installation.
				    </ul>
				</p>
				
				<li>If you connect your hardware with serial and/or USB your user
				  might not have the rights to access these ports. Connect your hardware
				  and look at the group ownership of that port. My hardware shows
				  up as /dev/ttyUSB0 and has group ownership "dialout".
				  <p class="example"> $ ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0 <br>
                                                      crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 4, 64 Feb 12 10:36 /dev/ttyUSB0</p>
                                  <p> Add yourself to that group </p>
				  <p class="example"> $ sudo adduser $USER dialout </p>
                                  <p> You may have already been in the group but that does not harm </p>
				<li>
				  <p> If you were added to the group, logout and login to make it take effect </p>
				<li>Get JMRI</li>
				    <p><a href="../download/index.shtml#prod-rel">Download</a> a version of JMRI, either the
				    latest production version, or a "test version".  Since the version
				    numbers change with every release, this link takes you to the general
				    JMRI download page, where you can select whichever version you like.</p>
				
				    <p>The JMRI project is continuously adding features, bug fixes,
				    examples and tutorials to the release, and so a new "test" versions
				    appear every couple of weeks.  You may find one of these has features
				    that you really want.  These are announced in the "JMRI users" Groups.io
				    discussion group at
				    <a
				     href="https://groups.io/g/jmriusers">https://groups.io/g/jmriusers</a>.
				    </p>
				
	  	<a id="update"></a>
				<li>Install JMRI</li>
				    <p>Uncompress/untar the file you downloaded above.  This will create a new "JMRI" folder.</p>
				    <p>Note: Each JMRI release is an independent set of files: It's intended to be used as a
				    whole.  Each release provides new files, and sometimes removes old files.
				    You should therefore <em>not</em> expand the download into the same place as an 
				    existing JMRI installation.  Instead, expand it into a separate location, and
				    move in to it's final destination, completely replacing any previous version of JMRI.
				    <p>To install, you just have to move that new JMRI folder to where you
				    want it on your computer.</p>				    

		<a id="startup"></a><h3>Starting JMRI</h3>
				<li>Installation is complete.<br>
				    You can run the program by using
				    the "DecoderPro", "PanelPro", or
				    "JmriDemo" scripts in the JMRI folder.  Change directory there, and
				    invoke a script with e.g. "./DecoderPro"</li>
				</ol>
